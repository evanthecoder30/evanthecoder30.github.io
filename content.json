{"posts":[{"title":"Road To Coding","text":"About MeTo make the introduction as short as possible, I am going to summarize myself into a few words. I am a student who majors in CS, a freelancer, and a blogger. My Github: https://github.com/evanthecoder30 My Email: ykz13552611927@gmail.com My Fiverr: search for my username -&gt; “caesarthecoder” Blog InformationThis blog serves as a recorder of my journey of learning computing machinery and it has a few attributes: It’s a place for everyone that wants to find inspiration from my experiences. In this blog, one can find the highest quality projects selected from Github.com, including multiple languages like C/C++, Python, Java and so forth. The ultimate purpose of the creation of this blog is to share knowledge with people who are interested in computer science and engineering. Most of the time, the blog will be updated often. A new Project Selection&amp;Review article will be posted online every week. As for fundamentals and techniques, I will post them as soon as I find anything worth sharing.","link":"/2023/02/18/Road2Coding/"},{"title":"The Best Operating System? Windows&#x2F;MacOS&#x2F;Linux","text":"Why Compare?Operating System (OS) is the intermedia between users and computers. By using an operating system, users can easily manipulate the software and hardware of their computers. OS has two essential purposes: to provide a friendly interface that is easy to learn and use &amp; to unleash more potential of the hardware. Most computer users care extremely about the former purpose because they do not want to spend too much time and energy learning how to use the operating system. Therefore, a friendly GUI and simple keybindings are the reason why most people choose either Windows or MacOS. However, it does not mean that Linux is the lowest rated among all three. Being extremely similar to Unix, Linux gives users the best control over the whole system from hardware to software. Windows As a Daily UserAccording to my residual memory about my childhood, the first OS I used is Windows. At that time, Windows did a good job on its GUI. I successfully learned how to use Windows in just an hour when I was very young. Hence, my first impression of Windows was almost perfect. Another reason that attracts me to use Windows is that it’s highly compatible. Nowadays, there is a lot of computer brand, like Lenovo, Huawei, ASUS, ThunderRobot, Dell, and Razer. Most of them have a CPU brand of either Intel or AMD, and other hardware is produced by different companies. However, despite the differences, Windows can be installed on all of them with great performance. However, Microsoft once announced that Win10 is going to be their long-term supporting OS version. However, they developed Win11 soon after and I do not think it’s an improvement. Hopefully, Microsoft can develop a better OS in the future.In the software layer, the lack of useful apps has never occurred. For office workers, Microsoft Office and WPS are both sets of tools to edit files. Gaming platforms like Steam can be easily installed on Windows. In short, Windows is amazingly friendly to “computer muggles”. As a Person in the Field of ITHowever, it’s a different story for IT guys. Most of them have special requirements for their computers, depending on the needs of their career. IDEs and IT toolsCommon apps installed on a computer for IT use are IDEs like JetBrains Toolbox and data traffic analyzers like Wireshark. Microsoft also developed its IDE called Visual Studio, and text/code editor called Visual Studio Code. Those two are easy to use. Command LineUnfortunately, Windows has this extremely unacceptable CMD that highly restricted the users’ control over the whole system. Nonetheless, Microsoft recently added a new terminal simulator called Powershell, which is a little better than CMD. Virtual MachinesTo use virtual machines on Windows, one can simply use a docker or apps like VMware, VirtualBox… VPNThe most important thing for IT is to look up information and its sources from multiple countries, so having a VPN installed on the operating system is necessary.Here are a few VPN that can be subscribed and used on Windows: ExpressVPN Winscribe Bandwagon NordVPN Shadowsocks(highly recommand to use it with clash-for-windows) MacOS As a Daily UserMacOS is an operating system designed especially for MacBook, a computer series created by Apple. Before owning my first MacBook, I had this stubborn feeling that MacOS is powerful, gorgeous, and easy to use OS. Nevertheless, some of that was right and the other parts are wrong.Frankly speaking, the easy-to-use feature is only a little better than Windows because the essence of these two OS is the same, which is concentrating on a graphical user interface other than the terminal and command line. Although the central idea about the design is the same, MacOS does a better job of providing a clean desktop for users because every app installed is only visible in the launch pad and dock located at the bottom of the screen. As a Person in the Field of ITIDEs and IT toolsIDEs and IT tools are also pretty straightforward to download and use on MacOS. The famous IDE developed by Apple is Xcode, which is designed especially for Swift and Objective-C developers and also provides support for C/C++. Other tools can be easily installed through the perfect Unix-like terminal using the “brew” command. By the way, to install homebrew, just run the following command: 1/bin/bash -c &quot;$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)&quot; TerminalCompared to the inconvenience brought by the Windows CMD and Powershell, the MacOS terminal did a great job of preserving the features of terminals on the Unix and Linux systems. By simply using the command: 1sudo su and entering the password, the user can gain full access to the whole computer, and run any command easily. Virtual MachinesAs for virtual machines on MacOS, I have used the VirtualBox for a while but I found it slows down the whole computer and lowers the performance. Therefore, I have to pay for a permanent subscription to an app called Parallel Desktop. Although it isn’t free, its fluency is what made it worthy of the money. Also, Parallel Desktop does not need you to download .iso files from the internet because it already has a lot of preinstalled OS distributions, like Ubuntu, Kali, Debian, and even Windows 11. VPNThe VPN I use on MacOS is Surge plus the yearly subscription plan of Shadowsocks. Surge is not a free VPN app but it’s also not expensive. Most importantly, Surge provides me with the most fluent user experience and it is highly compatible with MacOS. Linux As for Linux, things are completely different but also a lot easier to explain. As a Daily UserIf you want Linux to be a system that helps you deal with your ordinary needs, like writing an essay, sending emails, playing games, and so forth, then Linux is not the right choice for you. People who do not have a career related to CS are highly discouraged to use Linux because Linux focuses on the use of the terminal instead of the graphical interface. As a Person in the Field of ITIf you are a CS learner or a pro in the field of IT, then you must have heard that Linux is the best operating system in the whole world and throughout all time. Without a question, I agree with the saying. As I said above, MacOS gives users full control over the whole computer but Linux is even more awesome. IDEs and IT toolsJust one sentence to include all: just pick one and google the command to install it. TerminalI don’t even want to address this again. If you want a terminal that is easy to use, which also gives you full control over the computer, choose Linux! Virtual MachinesVMware or VirtualBox, just pick one! VPNPlease use Clash without a doubt! Linux: an Open-Source OSAnother important thing to address is that Linux is fully open-source. Created by Linus Torvalds, Linux was born to be free and will continue to be free in the future. The source code of the Linux Kernal is now available. ConclusionEvery OS has its way to make a living. Some of them depend on flexible GUI, and others focus more on the commandline and terminal. They have different target users, so choose wisely instead of judging without reasonable arguments.","link":"/2023/02/21/The-Best-Operating-System-Windows-MacOS-Linux/"},{"title":"Hello World","text":"Welcome to Hexo!
